<h2>Personal information</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Shahan Sarvari, my student number is 3897818 and my student email is  s3897818@student.rmit.edu.au . I am half iranian and half afghani, however I was  born and raised in Australia. I have completed VCE but I did year 12 over 2 years due to health issues. I can speak farsi to some extent and I am fluent in English. An interesting fact about me is that I had bone cancer in 2015, I ended up beating it and I have been cancer free now for over  4 years. I am also I massive league of legends fan.</p>
<h2>Interest In IT </h2>
<p>My interest in IT is programming and coding, the idea of being able to run a program using certain codes intrigues me. Being able to work and understand computers is also a large interest of mine, I feel I have very little knowledge of what potential they really have and exploring that will be fascinating. In my last year of VCE, my interest in IT began, my interest was sparked by the ever- increasing amounts of data being collected from pretty much everything in the world. I thought to myself “who is going to be able to manage all of this data”. It would seem to me that many future jobs will become available as the IT industry continues to rapidly grow, although I have no prior experience in IT, I am highly motivated and keen on becoming more knowledgeable in this field. I chose to come to RMIT after hearing from friends and family that RMIT has very good coarses and career outcomes for students interested in IT. I also have an older brother who went to RMIT, who mentioned that it is a great university and provides great opportunities in every coarse. My learning goals are to improve my ability to work in a team, I also want to efficiently program and code so that when in a real life scenario, I can work productively and excel at my job.</p>
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p>My ideal job is to become a software tester, I believe this job in particular involves running and testing gaming software that is used in a casino. The job also ensures that the software is running optimally and has no errors that may cause a malfunction. Teamwork may be a key part of the job as not everything can be done individually, so being able to adjust and adapt on the spot is also very important. I find games pretty fun, so being able to have a job that involves games would be ideal, this I what makes the job appealing to me. As of now, I meet very few of the qualifications, like meeting deadlines and communicating effectively. However this job requires 5 years of experience in software testing which I do not currently have, I am hoping to gain experience at a smaller job and then eventually move over to a more advanced job. Another qualification that is needed is a bachelor of information technology, I obviously do not have that right now but it is a goal that I am working towards and hoping to achieve. My plan for obtaining all of these requirements is to put a lot of effort into studying, understanding the concepts of programming, coding and working well with my fellow students in group assignments. </p>
<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<h3>-16 personalities</h3>
<a href=https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality>https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality </a>
<p> 
My 16 personalities test showed me that I’m an advocate, this to me means that I am someone who upholds my beliefs and views on the world. Advocates also tend to help others as a way of finding purpose in life, which leads me to believe that I can work well with others as I will value their success as much as mine. Being an advocate also gives me a sense of happiness because it has some what provided me with an answer as to why I require some alone time to process my thoughts and feelings. Advocates also seem to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive which can help me in team projects as I can leave a positive impression on others and establish friendliness. Advocates have weaknesses as well, so I must consider these when forming a team. For example, an advocate is sensitive to criticism, so I have be considerate of other peoples views of me and not allow them to impact me negatively, instead I should look at these critiques as a way to better myself.<h3> -Learning Test</h3>
<p>My learning test indicated that I am an auditory learner, this to me shows that I prefer hear and listen in order to learn. I believe this will be beneficial in teamwork because I will be able to absorb what others are saying just by listening, this can also be detrimental as my team members may think that I am not listening even though I am. In order to overcome this issue I believe eye contact and nodding will be important to show I am switched on and listening.</p>
<h3>-Big 5 Personality Test</h3>
<p>This test revealed that I have medium characteristics, at times I can be very creative, curious and adventurous, but at other times I prefer a routine. Being creative and adventurous means a lot to me, I think that someone who is creative can be very useful in everyday life, let alone just in the workspace. By adding creativity to a team I believe I can enhance the uniqueness of projects and programs by coming up with ideas that are not mainstream, I also think that employers will be drawn to those who are creative, which may help me find rewarding jobs in the future. Creativity can also be a negative thing, as others may see it as too ‘out of the box’, so when in a group I should consider the point of view of my team members. Overall I think being creative and adventurous would help my team in all aspects but I will have to take into account other ideas that are different from my own.</p>
<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3> 
<p>My project idea is a credit card tracking device. It will be a small piece made from certain materials that will be attachable to credit/debit cards in case they are lost. To access the location of the tracking device, the user will be required to download an application in which will show the live location of the device.  By showing the live location, the device will be very useful in particular situations as it can reveal whether the lost card is moving or if it is stationary.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>I was inspired to make such a device by my own personal experiences in which I lost my debit card and could not find it. Instead I had to wait over a week in order to get a new one mailed to me, this was a major inconvenience as I rely on my debit card. An alarming statistic that revealed over 11 million credit cards are reported lost or stolen in Australia also motivated me to create such a device. I believe, such an invention would be able to help so many people and improve their daily lives.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The tracking device will have multiple components that allow it to work. The outer shell of it will be made out of plastic, this is so that it does not have too much weight to it and can be more convenient to carry around. Several designs and colours will be available if the user decides that the base colour of the plastic is unappealing, custom stickers will also be available. Another component of the device  will be a built in clip that allows for the device to attach onto the credit/debit card, I believe that the clip will need to be made out of some sort of metal. A metal clip will provide durability, where as if the clip is plastic it may be prone to breaking or becoming damaged overtime. An important feature of the metal clip is that it will detach easily when someone wants it to come off, eg. ( when tapping or swiping the card). This will be possible by having a small red button on the device that relieves the pressure being put on the edge of the card by loosening the metal clips. To put the back on the card, a blue button will be on the device, which does the opposite of the red button. Upon clicking the blue button, the metal clips will compress together, this should be done whilst the card is in between the two clips/claws so that the tracking device can be reattached to the card.  The third component of the tracking device will be the battery, the device will contain a small lithium battery that can be recharged multiple times. Ideally the device should be charged overnight, or when the user has placed their card in a secure location. You may be thinking, “what if the card is lost when the device is charging?”, a simple solution will be purchasing two tracking devices so that one can be getting charged and one will be attached to the card. The lithium battery will be designed to have a long lasting life cycle to ensure optimal convenience for the user. The final component will be the tracking system network itself, the device will use a gps tracking system, this will ensure a reliable system. The gps tracker will be the same shape and size as a regular credit card and the plastic shell will surround it with the metal clip attaching the plastic to the card. The shape and size is like such because it will provide the device with a stylish and slim look, the shape will also allow the card to be placed in wallet pockets as the thinness allows for the device to fit pretty much anywhere the card can. As for the application, it will be available for apple and android users, it will serve similarly to “find my iphone”, you simply enter the unique code that is on the tracker in the app and it will be located through the gps system.</p>
<h3>Tools</h3>
<p>A gps system will be used  so that a reliable locating service can be provided to its users. MIT app inventor will be very important for the creation of the application</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>Upon successful production of the tracking device and its application, an easy solution will be provided to those who have lost their credit card or misplaced it. One problem is that the device will no longer be useful if a thief has stolen the card and taken off the tracker, the device will only be useful if it stays on the card. A solution to this issue is installing a unique key hole on the outer shell of the tracker that has a complimentary key that is given to the user upon purchase, this will mean that more production work will be required to attain such an outcome. However if the card isn’t stolen and is just misplaced, the user can simply use the app and enter their unique code, this will allow them to see where the card is and whether or not they’ll need to order a new one. Such invention would allow for a faster recovery of credit cards which can be beneficial for those who have an emergency.
